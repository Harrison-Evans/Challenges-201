Welcome to my Challenge Repo page!

This Repo is where we have stored our Challenges from 201 OPS class.

I am learning these skills to further my career as a cybersecurity professional.

In Ops 201 we have learned some really great concepts, scripting in multiple programs. VScode, PowerShell, and terminal! Additionally, fine tuning of security practices and automating scripts.

I would like to bring up one of my favorite Ops Challenges, Challenge 13.   
In this challenge we worked with finding information about a website domain then making a file that contained the info desired, feel free to check it out!
