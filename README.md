Welcome to my Challenge Repo page!

This Repo is where we have stored our Challenges from 201 OPS class.

Learning these skills to further my career as a cybersecurity professional.

In Ops 201 we have learned some really great concepts, scripting in multiple programs. VScode, PowerShell, and terminal! Additionally, fine tuning of security practices and automating scripts.

I would like to bring up one of my favorite Ops Challenges, Challenge 13.   
In this challenge we worked with finding information about a website domain then making a file that contained the info desired, feel free to check it out!

Thankful for GitHub for when I need to recall an automation, security practice or anything that may aid a future employer.

My mission with GitHub to to continue on all the scripts that I have done. Pull the scripts and practice on free time. 

Shell scripting is one I particularly would love to become fluid with, the interaction it provides, creative yet simplistic.
