#windows server 2019

#Step one:

#There are two steps to installing AD in Windows Server 2019. 
#The first is to install the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) server role. 
#The second step is to configure your server as a domain controller. 
#An AD domain must have at least one DC. 
#Your server will be the first DC in a new AD forest and domain.

#continuing..

#To complete the instructions below, you will need to have an account with administrator privileges in Windows Server 2019.
# I will also assume that you are using Windows Server 2019 with the Desktop Experience role installed. 
#If you are using Server Core, the instructions vary a little but are more or less the same.



#Active Directory prerequisites

#Step tewww:

#Before you install your first domain controller in the new AD domain, there are a couple of things you should do to prepare the server.
#While it’s not absolutely necessary, I recommend giving the computer a name that makes it easy to identify. 
#For example, I usually call the first domain controller in a new domain DC1. 
#Secondly, you’ll need to set a static IP address and configure the network adapter’s DNS server.

#Let’s start by renaming the server.

#Log in to Windows Server 2019 as an administrator.
#Open the Start menu and click the Windows PowerShell
#In the PowerShell window, run the command below and press ENTER. 
#Replace ‘DC1’ with the name that you would like to use for your domain controller.

#Rename-Computer -NewName DC1 # code to run for the action
#restart the server.

#Part three:

#Once the server has rebooted, we can configure the network adapter. 
#Your DC will need to communicate with other devices on the local network, 
#so it’s important to speak to whoever oversees your network and get them to provide you with a static IP address that isn’t already in use. 
#On my network, I will assign a static IP address of 192.168.1.10/24 and the default gateway is 192.168.1.1.

#Log in to Windows Server 2019 as an administrator.
#Open the Start menu and click the Windows PowerShell
#In the PowerShell window, run the New-NetIPAddress command below and press ENTER. 
#Replace the values for IPAddress, DefaultGateway, and PrefixLength to those provided by your network administrator.

#the code to run ^
#New-NetIPAddress –IPAddress 192.168.1.10 -DefaultGateway 192.168.1.1 -PrefixLength 24 -InterfaceIndex (Get-NetAdapter).InterfaceIndex

#The above command is designed to work on servers that have only one network adapter installed.
#If you have more than one adapter, you’ll need to enter the interface number instead of (Get-NetAdapter).InterfaceIndex. 
#You can get the interface index number (ifIndex) for each adapter using Get-NetAdapter.

#Part Four:
#Now configure the adapter’s DNS settings.
# We’ll set the preferred DNS server to be our domain controller’s IP address because the domain controller will also perform the function of DNS server for the domain.
# So, replace 192.168.1.10 with the same IP address you configured for the adapter. 
#Run Set-DNSClientServerAddress as shown, 
#and press ENTER.


#Set-DNSClientServerAddress –InterfaceIndex (Get-NetAdapter).InterfaceIndex –ServerAddresses 192.168.1.10
#Again, the command is designed to work on servers that have only one network adapter installed. 
#If you have more than one adapter, you’ll need to enter the interface number instead of (Get-NetAdapter).InterfaceIndex.

#Part Five:
#Install the Active Directory Domain Services role

#The next step is to install the AD DS server role. 
#It’s easy to do using the Install-WindowsFeature cmdlet as shown below. 
#If you are using Server Core, remove the -IncludeManagementTools parameter.

#Install-WindowsFeature -name AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools
#https://petri.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Figure2-6.png 

#Once the AD DS server role is installed, you’ll get a message in the PowerShell window. 
#The Success column should read True.

#Part Six:
#Configure the first domain controller in a new Active Directory FOREST

#Before you continue, 
#you should decide on a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for your new domain. 
# Like our CORP one for example. Where ‘CORP’ is the name of my new domain and globexpower.com is the top-level domain (TLD). 
#You should make sure that you own the public TLD. 
#In this example, I should own the globexpower.com domain name. 
#AD in the FQDN defines my internal DNS namespace for Active Directory.

#Part Six continuing,

#To configure Windows Server 2019 as a domain controller, 
#run Install-ADDSForest as shown in the example below. 
#Replace corp.globexpower.com with your chosen FQDN. 
#DomainNetBIOSName is usually set to the part of your FQDN that identifies your internal AD DNS namespace. 
#So, the part that comes to the left of the first period. In this case, ‘ad’.

#run
#Install-ADDSForest -DomainName ad.contoso.com -DomainNetBIOSName AD -InstallDNS

#You should note that Install-ADDSForest is only used when you are installing the first domain controller in a new AD forest.
#Install-ADDSDomain and Install-ADDSDomainController are used respectively to create a new domain in an existing forest and install a new DC in an existing AD domain.

#DomainName and DomainNetBIOSName are the only two compulsory parameters for the Install-ADDSForest cmdlet.
# If you want to explore what other options you can configure, run the command line below:
#Get-Help Install-ADDSForest


#When you run the Install-ADDSForest cmdlet,
#you’ll be prompted to enter a password for Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM). 
#Or Safe Mode password as it’s sometimes referred to. 
#Enter a password and confirm it when prompted.

#You’ll then see a message:

#The target server will be configured as a domain controller and restarted when this operation is complete.
#Do you want to continue with this operation?

#Type y in the PowerShell window and press ENTER to confirm that you want to configure the server as a domain controller.
#https://petri.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Figure4-4.png 

#As AD is configured, you’ll see some yellow warnings appear in the PowerShell window. 
#They are normal and you can safely ignore them. 
#The server will automatically reboot. 
#Once Windows Server has rebooted, you will need to log in with the domain administrator account. 
#The domain administrator account is assigned the same password as the built-in administrator account.

#continuing

#On the sign-in page, type administrator in the User name field. 
#Type the password for the administrator account, 
#which is the same as the password for the previous built-in administrator account, 
#and press ENTER.

#finsihing
#And that is it! 
#You are now logged in to your AD domain’s first domain controller. 
#You can access Server Manager from the Start menu. 
#In Server Manager, 
#click the Tools menu and then select Active Directory Users and Computers to start managing your domain.
